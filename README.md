# SpendNTrack_Backend
SpendNTrack_Backend is a backend repository which is a part of an expense tracking microservice SaaS app.

The intention for the project is to build an expense tracker for myself to track all my spendings and simultaneously taking this up as an opportunity to show off my backend skill on creating microservice architecture.
